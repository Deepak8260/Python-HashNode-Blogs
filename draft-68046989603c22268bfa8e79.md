To demonstrate that **`async` and `await`** do not work as expected in older versions of Flask (especially before Flask 2.0), we can modify the code to show how Flask handles async functions, even though it doesn't provide true async behavior. 

You can use the older Flask version (e.g., `Flask 1.x`) and see how it doesn't allow true concurrency, even with `async` functions.

### Code Changes:

- **Flask 1.x** does not natively support `async` functions in a way that Flask 2.x does, so we can add a test function with `async` and simulate blocking behavior to see it doesn't achieve real async concurrency.

#### Hereâ€™s your modified `flask_async_blocking.py`:

```python
from flask import Flask
import asyncio
from time import sleep

app = Flask(__name__)

# Simulating a blocking async route by using time.sleep (blocking function)
@app.route("/slow")
async def slow():
    print("Started /slow")
    sleep(5)  # Using time.sleep instead of asyncio.sleep (blocking function)
    print("Finished /slow")
    return "Done with slow"

# A fast route to see the difference
@app.route("/fast")
def fast():
    print("Handling /fast")
    return "Fast response"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="127.0.0.1", port=8000, debug=True)
```

### Why This Code Shows Blocking:

1. **`async` in Flask 1.x**: Flask 1.x (and earlier versions) doesn't process async functions properly. The `async` keyword doesn't offer true concurrency in older Flask versions. Even though we use `async def` for the `/slow` route, Flask will still handle the request in a **blocking manner** because Flask isn't built to run asynchronous code.
   
2. **Blocking Nature**: We used `sleep(5)` (a blocking call) instead of `asyncio.sleep(5)`. This simulates blocking behavior, which will block the entire thread for 5 seconds. Even though the function is `async`, it still doesn't achieve non-blocking behavior, so both requests (one to `/slow` and another to `/fast`) will block.

3. **Expected Outcome**: If you visit `/slow` and `/fast` simultaneously, Flask will block the `/slow` route and hold the thread for 5 seconds, causing delays even for the fast route.

### How to Test It:
1. **Install Flask 1.x**:
   If you don't already have it, install **Flask 1.x** to run this test. You can install a specific version like `Flask 1.1.2`:

   ```bash
   pip install flask==1.1.2
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   Start the Flask server using the command:

   ```bash
   python flask_async_blocking.py
   ```

3. **Test with Browser or cURL**:
   - Open your browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/slow` in one tab and `http://127.0.0.1:8000/fast` in another tab simultaneously.
   - You'll see that `/slow` will take a long time to respond (5 seconds due to `sleep`), and `/fast` will also wait if the `/slow` route is still being processed.

### Key Takeaway:
This will show that even if we use `async` with Flask 1.x, it doesn't give us real concurrency. Flask will block the request because the server doesn't fully support asynchronous execution. The route will still behave synchronously due to the blocking call in `sleep(5)`.
